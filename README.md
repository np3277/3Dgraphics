# 3Dgraphics
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for a 3D mesh data preprocessing assignment. The goal is to prepare 3D mesh data for Al model consumption by performing normalization and quantization of vertex coordinates, followed by reconstruction and error analysis. This preprocessing ensures consistent coordinate ranges.
